        <p>Background
Since ancient times, education has been recognized as an important factor for the amelioration of human conditions in a social setting. Greek thinkers like Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle were all aware of the role of education in society. Plato, in fact, had a very comprehensive scheme of education for his contemplated ideal state. He clearly understood that the philosopher king should have sufficient education to conduct the affairs of the state. In other civilizations also education was accorded an important place in their scheme of things, especially in their objective of attaining a good society. Kautilya in Athasastra and Khaldun in his Mukkadama have greatly emphasised the role of education in achieving ideal society.</p>
